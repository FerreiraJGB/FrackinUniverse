"SPECIMEN REPORT #33621A

Specimen J-11 is an engima to us all, and that's exactly what makes it so promising as a bioweapon. We discovered, almost by accident, that it had the ability to spew fire and extrude spikes from its torso and shoulders the other day. At least, we THINK they're shoulders. Standard condolences letters have been dispatched to the appropriate families.",

"We've ordered maximum containment measures for J-11. There will be no repeat of what happened at Zeta Cygnus II. Enough time and money have already been wasted on setbacks and unfortunate incidents; senior management wants results, and soon. These results are already in sight, but we need to be careful.",

"The most promising - and alarming thing about J-11 is that all of its lifesigns appear to point to the fact that there is something else growing in this monstrous creature - that this beast appears to be a mere chrysalis, and that once whatever it is has fully matured, it will emerge from the lifeless husk in an act of ecdysis. Further examination is definitely warranted."
